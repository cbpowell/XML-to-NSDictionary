The key ideas:

  1 XML elements map to key names in the dictionary
  2 Each element corresponds to a child dictionary
  3 Attribute key-value pairs are added to the element’s child dictionary
  4 Strings from text nodes are assigned to the child dictionary’s “text” key
  5 If an element name is encountered multiple times, the value of the element is set to an array of children dictionaries

----Additions to NSDictionary----
The retrieveForPath: method allows easy selection of items in a nested NSDictionary structure, using a string in the familar dot syntax. For example, the following nested NSDictionary:

NSDictionary *exampleDict =
{
  results = {
      example1 = {
          hash = 4H5keM;
          string1 = "foo";
          string2 = "bar";
          userDetails = {
              firstName = "John";
              lastName = "Smith";
          };
      };
  };
  statusCode = OK;
}

The firstName value can be quickly access by using [exampleDict retrieveForPath:@"results.example1.userDetails.firstName"]
